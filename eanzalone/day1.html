			<li>I didn't realize you couldn't overlap 'strong' and 'em' tags. (And I assume other tags as well.) I bet that makes things messy.</li>
			<li>"Do not close empty elements in HTML mode." But it's only talking about Firefox? Is it good practice to close them anyway?</li>
			<li>I never put two and two together to understand why quotes/ampersands/etc were written as codes in HTML. It makes so much sense now!</li>
